                This website was developed with the idea of enabling users to compare different countries
                of the world based on different criteria such as nightlife, friendliness to foreigners,
                access to free wifi, cost of life for locals, nomads, expats etc. The number of criteria by
                which the user can visualize the differences is 20.
            </p>

            <p>
                As digital nomads are people who usually make a living by working remotely over the internet,
                frequently changing countries of residence, this could be an interesting tool for them when
                choosing a new destination.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Data Collection</h3>
            <p>The data was collected from the Nomad List API, which has been closed during the previous  week. Fortunately we have saved the aggregated data on our machines. The owner of the website is willing to give api keys to people who are not trying to copy the website. We have contacted him in order to have live data.</p>
            <h3 class="text-center">Stack</h3>
            <p>The server was written in python, using the web.py library and the data munging was performed using the pandas library.
                The visualisations on the client side were made by using the datamaps library and Java Script. </p>
