            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

            <h3 class="text-center">Data Collection</h3>
            <p>The data was collected from the Nomad List API, which has been closed during the previous  week. Fortunately we have saved the aggregated data on our machines. The owner of the website is willing to give api keys to people who are not trying to copy the website. We have contacted him in order to have live data.</p>
            <h3 class="text-center">Stack</h3>
            <p>The server was written in python, using the web.py library and the data munging was performed using the pandas library.
                The visualisations on the client side were made by using the datamaps library and Java Script. </p>
